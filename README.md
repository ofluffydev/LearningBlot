# Blot Project

This project is a collection of JavaScript files that generate different shapes using the Hackclub's "blot" library. The "blot" library is a powerful tool for creating generative art in JavaScript.

## Files

1. `ExpandingSquareSpiral.js`: This file generates an expanding square spiral. It uses a custom spiral function and the `bt.catmullRom()` function from the "blot" library.

2. `Pentagon.js`: This file generates a simple pentagon shape. It's based on an example from a tutorial.
